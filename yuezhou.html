                            When you have seen this page, it means that I have successfully become a Full-Stack Ninja.
                            I am 23 year old now, born in China.
                            I graduated from Imperial College London, class of 2017, with a master degree in Mechanical Engineering.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I am currently working as a developer in Japan.
                            Below, I shared my featured work in three of my specialised fields. 
                            Please take a quick look and I hope you enjoy my Portfolio!
                            Oh btw, I really love traveling.
