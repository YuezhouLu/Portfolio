## Project Overview
For this project, we'll be building a portfolio website. we will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and we must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. We will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links. Please note that while we should aim to recreate the mockup, we may also use our own custom images to personalize this project. Once we've successfully replicated the design mockup, we are encouraged to continue tweaking and making customizations to the design to personalize it and make it our own!


## Why this Project?
The first thing potential employers look for isn’t which school we attended or what our GPA was; they want to see what we’ve built! We need a professional portfolio to show off our skills. In this project we built a great looking portfolio where we can show off images and descriptions. Without a portfolio, recruiters won’t even look at our resume much less interview us. At their very foundation, web applications are just content delivery mechanisms; HTML defines how that language is structured. Reading poorly designed content is never an enjoyable experience; CSS empowers us to create beautiful content regardless of our user’s device.


## Skills Honed
Learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. In addition, learnt how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.
