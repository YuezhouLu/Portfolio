                            When you have seen this page, it means that I have successfully become a Full-Stack Ninja.
                            I am 23 years old now, born in China.
                            I graduated from Imperial College London, class of 2017, with a master degree in Mechanical Engineering.
                            I am currently working as a Data Analyst & Full-Stack Developer at JGC Corporation, the largest Japanese Oil and Gas EPC contractor, located in Yokohama, Japan.

                            This page is a quick demo of my Front-End website building skill.
                            It is generated purely with HTML and CSS, without using any libraries or frameworks.
                            I configured the styling of this page by adjusting and refining the Box Models.
                            This webpage should be fully-responsive, so do give it a try!
                            Click <a href="https://github.com/YuezhouLu">here</a> to visit my GitHub homepage, please do not hesitate to take a look at my pinned repositories.

                            Below, I shared three of my featured working fields.
                            Please take a glance and I hope you enjoy my brief Portfolio!
                            Oh btw, I really love traveling.
                            Wanna travel together with me someday?
                            Cannot wait to see you guys (-:</p>
